	- Screws

	- 120VAC outlets




	

	- 12V -> 5V converter?

		- The rule of thumb is to put in 1 Farad of capacitance for every 1,000 watts RMS of total system power

		- Capacitance in Farads F = Current I x time t / voltage dV

		- Farads = (Amps * seconds) / Volts

		So ....

		(1A * s)
		--------    =    0.000022
		    5

		s = (0.000022 * 5)

		Class 2 capacitor? :: Class 2 ceramic capacitors offer high volumetric efficiency, i.e. large capacitance for a given volume for smoothing, by-pass, coupling and decoupling applications.



		Electrolytic capacitor temp:
		-40 to 125Â° C







	- Screws (for LED units)

		3.5mm diam max?
		== 0.13"

	- Extension cords (get some for the house)

		- Figure out what I need
